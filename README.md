# Mining_helmet

This is a smart helmet created for the miners who work at the coal mines. This helmet senses the harmful gases below the mines like CO2 and CO and thus warns the miners to stay safe. It also has a smart light that switches on when the environment becomes dark. Also it detects the temperature of the surrounding in the coal mines.

We use DHT11 sensor for temperature measurement.
